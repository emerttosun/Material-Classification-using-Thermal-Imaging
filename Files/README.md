# Run Code

## Setup 
We developed the project using Python 3.10.9 .

For required third party libraries  :

```
pip install opencv-python
pip install torch torchvision
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
After setup the libraries, code can be run with dataset. We will publish all dataset in future. For running code, excel file must include your directory.
